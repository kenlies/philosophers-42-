## My hive (42) school philosophers project [BONUSES]
- A synchronized simulation of the dining philosophers problem

This project was all about learning to use threads & mutexes for the mandatory part to achieve a synchronized simulation of the dining philosophers problem, where no dataraces (or leaks ofc) were tolerated.
For the bonus section we had to use processes and semaphores for achieving pretty much the same goal, although this time all of the forks were put on the middle of the table. So any philo could pickup any fork, but there still needed to be, like in the mandatory part, the same amount of forks as philos.

If you are not familiar of the dining philosophers problem, then I suggest to read about it online. And I have included the subject.
